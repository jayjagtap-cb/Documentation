## sinfo

Shows different Nodes and their status, from here you can figure out if any node is down/idle or in mix state.
```
[lab@sc-r11r7-s1 ~]$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
system5*     up   infinite      1    mix sc-r11r7-s1
system5*     up   infinite      2   idle sc-r11r7-s[2-3]
```

## squeue 
```
[lab@sc-r11r7-s1 ~]$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
             12505   system5 singular      lab  R       2:02      1 sc-r11r7-s1
```

## scancel
From squeue, you will get actively running jobs. To cancel them and free up the node use scancel.
```
 scancel 12505
```

## Removing a down node from worker nodes.
This removes a node from the mongo db database but make sure to add the node back once the node is up. See next.
```
cb_cli system remove-host -s system9 sc-r11r7-s9.cerebrassc.local
```

## Adding a node back to db
```
cb_cli system add-host -s system9 sc-r11r7-s9.cerebrassc.local
```
